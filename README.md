# Codeless-ETL
In this demo I will be giving everyone a brief introduction to Azure Data Factory and Mapping Data Flows. It is my intention to show how codeless etl works iwth Mapping dataflows and how it enables development of complex code in a short amount of time.

In this demo I will build pipelines using the AdventureWorks database and will be using two tables from that database.


## Environment Setup

## 1. Simple Data Flow

## 2. Insert Slowly changed records
